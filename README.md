# Mall Customers Segmentation - K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting mall customers into distinct groups using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By leveraging customer data such as age, annual income, and spending score, the goal is to identify different customer segments to assist mall management in making informed decisions on targeting and retaining customers.

## Project Motivation
Understanding the shopping behaviors and characteristics of different customer groups can provide several benefits for mall management:
- Target moderate spenders to increase overall profits.
- Nurture premium customers with tailored services.
- Encourage low spenders to upgrade their spending through innovative strategies.

## Dataset Features
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
- **Customer ID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer.
- **Age**: The age of the customer.
- **Annual Income**: The annual income of the customer (in thousands).
- **Spending Score**: A score assigned based on spending behavior and loyalty.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and scaling features.
2. **K-Means Clustering**: Applied K-Means clustering to group customers.
   - The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method.
3. **Cluster Analysis**: Interpreted the characteristics of each cluster to provide actionable insights.
4. **Visualization**: Plots were used to visualize clusters and relationships between features.

## Key Insights
- **Moderate Spenders**: Identified, offering potential for targeted marketing to boost profits.
- **Premium Customers**: Showed higher spending scores, requiring tailored retention strategies.
- **Low-Spenders**: An opportunity to upgrade this segment with personalized offers.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mall-customers-segmentation.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, apply K-Means clustering, and generate visualizations.

## Future Work
- Experiment with other clustering algorithms such as Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN.
- Explore additional features like customer purchase history or online behavior to enhance segmentation.
- Integrate the model with a dashboard for real-time customer insights.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of K-Means clustering in segmenting mall customers based on spending patterns. The insights generated can help mall management improve marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.
